* Clustering/Classification techniques

# Issues
* Many similar projects online.  Practically identical to @jk6247's idea.
* Defining what represents a change in music 
* Change in music may not show up in Hot100.  A lot of influential music never made the chart. According to Complex magazine, only 61 number one songs can be considered  to be in the hip hop genre https://www.complex.com/music/2018/07/every-no-1-rap-song-in-hot-100-history/.  In addition, trends in music often remain underground for years before making it to the Hot100 list.  
* Relating changes in music to changes in society.  Hard to make causal inference.  Difficult to define. 
* Findings may be trivial.  For example, we don't need data science to infer the decline of rock's influence on pop music. 

# Possible New Directions 
* Find the trendsetters in music.  Find general shifts in pop music and find out the first artists to make it into the Hot100 for each trend.
* Create a predictive model for 2019 hits.  Train model on previous years and evaluate whether the model can correctly classify new music as a potential hit.  
* Maybe go in a totally different direction.  Considering doing education research using NYC OpenData.
